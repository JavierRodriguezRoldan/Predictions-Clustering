## Predictions & Clustering on bike rental data
These are two Statistical learning exercises related to Clustering and different prediction algorithms about the amount of times bikes will be rented.
The files "test_160523.csv" and "train_160523.csv" are the raw data, the train file includes the dependent variables and the test data does not. Also, the "Metada.txt" is the explanation of the meaning of the variables in the datasets. The file "Home_exercise_2.docx" are the instructions for both exercises and another bonus one. The other Word file with my name on it is the report written explaining the process and the results. R was used for this task, the R script it is also uploaded and it is commented too.
Thanks for reading!
